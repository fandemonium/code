# to use seqboot #
1. align sequences with outgroups (sina)
2. convert fasta to sequential form (change awk "1,10" based on the length of your id) 
```
awk '$1=substr($1"       ",1,10)"  "' FS="\n" OFS= RS=\> 16s_plus_1037_silva_aligned.fasta > test.fa 
```
3. count number of sequences (`grep -c ">" *.fasta`)
4. count the length of sequences (`python length_summary.py *.fasta`)
5. `vi test.fa` to add `the sequence count \t length of the longest seq (should be the same, because everything is aligned)`
